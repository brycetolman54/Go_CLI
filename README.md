# Todo CLI Application

Todo:
- [ ] edit should be its own command with flags to edit whatever thing
- [ ] you should persist a list of the categories so that you can list them
- [ ] you should be able to list by category
- [ ] figure out how to set due dates and update priorty based on proximity to a due date whenever you list things
- [ ] make it an option to list with the category
- [ ] you have to make it so the sort also looks at the priority
- [ ] you could have an option to list things with the categories highlighted by background by category (or you can add a precedent for category and sort by that as well)
- [ ] finish the readme
- all of this is not high priority

This is a repository holding the code for a todo list manager command-line application that I wrote (with much assistance) in Go to have some practice both using Go and writing a command line application with Cobra
